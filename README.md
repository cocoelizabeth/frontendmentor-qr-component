## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was mainly just a warm-up/practice, so I didn't really learn anything new from it. But I did learn how to set up a GitHub page for the project. 
1. Go to the project repo and click the **Settings** button. 
2. Under **Code and automation** go to **Pages**
3. Under **Build and deployment** > **Branch** chose the branch you want to deploy from. In this case, **main**
4. Click the **Save** buttom

### Continued development

I also could have implemented this with CSS grid. I probably will just move on from this project and try some more challenging ones.


### Useful resources

- [How to Host a Website On Github Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OltY8JIaP-4) - This helped me set up GitHub pages. He also mentions a different workflow for setting it up if it is your personal website which I may use in the future.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This is an amazing resource/game for learning CSS flexbox.
